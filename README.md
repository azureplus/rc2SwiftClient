# Rc2 Swift Client

This project is a rewrite of the [Rc2-client](https://github.com/wvuRc2/rc2client) project started at WVU 4-5 years ago. There was a lot of legacy cruft from old features that are no longer needed.

This version is a complete rewrite in Swift, though where possible it is a pretty straight forward port of the Objective C code.
