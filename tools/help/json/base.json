The name of the site file is the one pointed to by the environment variable R_ENVIRON; if this is unset, R_HOME/etc/Renviron.site is used (if it exists, which it does not in a factory-fresh installation). The name of the user file can be specified by the R_ENVIRON_USER environment variable; if this is unset, the files searched for are .Renviron in the current or in the user's home directory (in that order). See Details for how the files are read. Then searches for the site-wide startup profile file of code unless the command line option --no-site-file was given. The path of this file is taken from the value of the R_PROFILE environment variable (after tilde expansion). If this variable is unset, the default is R_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site, which is used if it exists unix (which it does not in a factory-fresh installation). windows (it contains settings from the installer in a factory-fresh installation). This code is sourced into the base package. Users need to be careful not to unintentionally overwrite objects in base, and it is normally advisable to use local if code needs to be executed: see the examples. Then, unless --no-init-file was given, searches for a user profile, a file of code. The path of this file can be specified by the R_PROFILE_USER environment variable (and tilde expansion will be performed). If this is unset, a file called .Rprofile is searched for in the current directory or in the user's home directory (in that order). The user profile file is sourced into the workspace. Note that when the site and user profile files are sourced only the base package is loaded, so objects in other packages need to be referred to by e.g.\\\\ifelse{latex}{\\\\out{~}}{ }latex~ utils::dump.frames or after explicitly loading the package concerned. then loads a saved image of the user workspace from .RData in the current directory if there is one (unless --no-restore-data or --no-restore was specified on the command line). Next, if a function .First is found on the search path, it is executed as .First(). Finally, function .First.sys() in the base package is run. This calls require to attach the default packages specified by options(\"defaultPackages\"). If the methods package is included, this will have been attached earlier (by function .OptRequireMethods()) so that namespace initializations such as those from the user workspace will proceed correctly. A function .First (and .Last) can be defined in appropriate .Rprofile or Rprofile.site files or have been saved in .RData. If you want a different set of packages than the default ones when you start, insert a call to options in the .Rprofile or Rprofile.site file. For example, options(defaultPackages = character()) will attach no extra packages on startup (only the base package) (or set R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=NULL as an environment variable before running ). Using options(defaultPackages = \"\") or R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=\"\" enforces the R system default. On front-ends which support it, the commands history is read from the file specified by the environment variable R_HISTFILE (default .Rhistory in the current directory) unless --no-restore-history or --no-restore was specified. The command-line option --vanilla implies --no-site-file, --no-init-file, --no-environ and (except for R CMD) --no-restore windows Under Windows, it also implies --no-Rconsole, which prevents loading the Rconsole file.
